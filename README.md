# Tiny Tic Tac Toe Game

I was dared to make a tic tac toe game in half an hour.
From initial commit to fist prototype I spent roughly 45 minutes on it - so not quite as fast as I wanted to be, but I _had to_ at least make it sort of pretty.

## How to play
* Make sure you have php installed  
* Run the `GameController.php` in your terminal  
* Play game!
